A work-in-progress port to the browser of the c++ gispl implementation.

## Gestural Interface Specification Language

GISpL enables the unambiguous description of gestures used in human-computer interfaces. This includes gestures on touch and multi-touch screens, with digital pens, with hand-held controllers or in free air. A matching engine analyzes motion data produced by the input device(s) and triggers registered gestures.
